# Real Time Bus Tracker
## Project Description
In this project for class we used our knowledge of working with api's and json to get real time information on the locations of buses in the Boston area. We took that information which is given to us in json format. We took the data and superimposed it over a google map html object. 

## How to Run
You can run this by either cloning the repository, or downloading a copy of the entire repository.

## Future 
As my coding skills continue to develop, I might add to this project.
Ideas
- Add a layer for the subway system
- Add a layer for the commuter rail
- Let user know how late/early buses ans trains are.
